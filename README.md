# Geo2Gmsh
This contribution presents Geo2Gmsh, a modular workflow in Python that extends Gmsh accessibility and capabilities to deliver a streamlined workflow for geoscientists interested in conducting numerical simulations. Geo2Gmsh includes high-level functions that enable the automated creation of 3D geological unstructured meshes from text files (.txt) containing x, y, and z coordinates sampled from irregular surfaces, faults, and wells. With Geo2Gmsh, it is also effortless to refine the produced mesh around these topological elements. Finally, it is straightforward to assign physical group identifiers, which can be recalled by external numerical solvers. Thus, Geo2Gmsh makes the meshing routine more efficient and accessible for users with limited experience.

Geo2Gmsh provides high-level functions that greatly reduce the learning curve and meshing time for beginners. Nonetheless, some limitations remain: (1) faults and wells can intersect only a single interface, (2) relative movement along faults cannot be simulated, and (3) internal bodies within layers are not yet supported. While some of these issues can be handled within numerical solvers, they will be addressed in future releases.
