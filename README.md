# Geo2Gmsh
This contribution presents Geo2Gmsh, a modular Python workflow that extends Gmsh for geoscientists. It automates 3D mesh generation from coordinate files, allows local refinement around wells, faults, and surfaces, and assigns physical group IDs for use in external numerical solvers, simplifying meshing for beginners.
