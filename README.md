# Geo2Gmsh
This contribution presents Geo2Gmsh, a modular Python workflow that extends Gmshâ€™s accessibility and capabilities, providing a streamlined solution for geoscientists conducting numerical simulations. The workflow enables the automated generation of 3D unstructured geological meshes from text files (.txt) containing x, y, and z coordinates sampled from irregular surfaces, faults, and wells. Local mesh refinement around these topological elements is straightforward, and physical group identifiers can be assigned easily for use with external numerical solvers. As a result, Geo2Gmsh simplifies the meshing process and reduces the learning curve for users with limited experience.

Despite these advantages, some limitations remain: (1) faults and wells can intersect only a single interface, (2) relative movement along faults cannot be simulated, and (3) internal bodies within layers are not yet supported. While certain issues can be addressed within numerical solvers, they will be resolved in future releases.
